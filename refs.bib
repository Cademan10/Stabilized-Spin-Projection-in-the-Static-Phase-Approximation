The methods are studied within a solvable model, the nuclear SU(3) Elliot model. The SPA partition function is enhanced compared with the MFA partition function and is in good agreement with the exact result at all angular velocities (or spins) and at all but low temperatures. The error made in the SPA as well as in the saddle-point approximation used in the conversion from angular velocity to spin is only weakly dependent on the spin and is small at not too low temperatures (or excitation energies).},

Restricting the calculation of the HFB partition function to a subspace with good quantum numbers through projection after variation restores some of the correlations lost in breaking these symmetries, although effects of the broken symmetries such as sharp kinks at phase transitions remain. However, the most general projection after variation formula in the finite-temperature HFB approximation is limited by a sign ambiguity. Here, we extend the Pfaffian formula for the many-body traces of HFB density operators introduced by L. M. Robledo in Ref. [1] to eliminate this sign ambiguity and evaluate the more complicated many-body traces required in projection after variation in the most general HFB case. We validate our method through a proof-of-principle calculation of the particle-number-projected HFB thermal energy in a simple model.},

However, implementing these methods on computers with finite-precision arithmetic requires careful attention to numerical stability. In the auxiliary-field Monte Carlo (AFMC) method, low-temperature or large-model-space calculations require numerically stabilized matrix multiplication. When adapting methods used in the grand-canonical ensemble to the canonical ensemble of fixed particle number, the numerical stabilization increases the number of required floating-point operations for computing observables by a factor of the size of the single-particle model space, and thus can greatly limit the systems that can be studied. We describe an improved method for stabilizing canonical-ensemble calculations in AFMC that exhibits better scaling, and present numerical tests that demonstrate the accuracy and improved performance of the method.}

We show that composite zero-frequency excitations are properly treated within the collective coordinate method. The resulting perturbation theory is free from infrared divergences. Without the assumption of individual random spin vectors, we derive microscopically the spin distribution of the level density. The moment of inertia is thereby related to the spin-cutoff parameter in the usual way. Explicit calculations are performed for 56\textasciicircum Fe/ various thermal properties are discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that the increase of the moment of inertia with increasing temperature is correlated with the suppression of pairing correlations.},

We study the thermal and rotational dependence of the orientation probability distribution within the constant average spin constraint. Orientation fluctuations are also computed with the macroscopic Landau theory of hot rotating nuclei, and the results compare favorably with those of the microscopic HFB calculations. The equilibrium nuclear orientation is calculated as a function of temperature and spin to investigate the possibility of stable tilted rotation for this nucleus.

title = {Low-energy enhancement and fluctuations of γ-ray strength functions in 56,57Fe: test of the Brink–Axel hypothesis},
journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {Nuclear level densities and γ-ray strength functions of 56,57Fe have been extracted from proton-γ coincidences. A low-energy enhancement in the γ-ray strength functions up to a factor of 30 over common theoretical E1 models is confirmed. Angular distributions of the low-energy enhancement in 57Fe indicate its dipole nature, in agreement with findings for 56Fe. The high statistics and the excellent energy resolution of the large-volume LaBr3(Ce) detectors allowed for a thorough analysis of γ strength as function of excitation energy. Taking into account the presence of strong Porter–Thomas fluctuations, there is no indication of any significant excitation energy dependence in the γ-ray strength function, in support of the generalized Brink–Axel hypothesis.}

  abstract = {We develop a formalism for calculating the distribution of the axial quadrupole operator in the laboratory frame within the rotationally invariant framework of the configuration-interaction shell model. The calculation is carried out using a finite-temperature auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. We apply this formalism to isotope chains of even-mass samarium and neodymium nuclei, and show that the quadrupole distribution provides a model-independent signature of nuclear deformation. Two technical advances are described that greatly facilitate the calculations. The first is to exploit the rotational invariance of the underlying Hamiltonian to reduce the statistical fluctuations in the Monte Carlo calculations. The second is to determine quadruple invariants from the distribution of the axial quadrupole operator. This allows us to extract effective values of the intrinsic quadrupole shape parameters without invoking an intrinsic frame or a mean-field approximation.},

This enhancement compensates for a corresponding suppression which occurs at negative temperatures. The saddle-point approximation used in converting the partition function to the level density works well at all but low energies.}

The J-dependence of the level density at fixed excitation energy E\_x is usually parameterized via the spin-cutoff factor sigma. We carefully test the statistical accuracy of this parameterization for a large number of spectra computed using semi-realistic interactions in the interacting shell model, with a nonlinear least-squares fit of sigma and finding the error bar in sigma. The spin-cutoff parameterization works well as long as there are enough states to be statistical. In turn, the spin-cutoff factor can be related to the average value of J\textasciicircum 2 at a fixed excitation energy, and we briefly investigate extracting {$<$}J\textasciicircum 2 (E\_x){$>$} from a thermal calculation such as one might do via Monte Carlo.},
